#Boilerplate Vanilla GitHook
This is a very simple GitHook boilerplate project to help you develop your first Node GitHook.

#Install
```
git clone https://github.com/GitHooksIO/boilerplate-githook.git
cd boilerplate-githook
npm install request
```

You may want to [create a Personal Access Token](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-an-access-token-for-command-line-use/) for testing purposes.

You're ready to start developing!

#Contribute
When your GitHook is ready to use, please [contribute your GitHook](http://githooks.io/contribute) to GitHooks.io.

Please make absolutely sure you've not committed your personal access token to the repository at any point (and revoke your access token from GitHub just to be safe).

Also, please fill out the details in `.githook.yml` properly before you contribute your GitHook.
