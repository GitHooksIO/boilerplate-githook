#Boilerplate Vanilla GitHook
This is a very simple GitHook boilerplate project to help you develop your first Node GitHook.

#Install
```
git clone https://github.com/GitHooksIO/boilerplate-githook.git
cd boilerplate-githook
npm install request
```

Now you'll want to [create a Personal Access Token](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-an-access-token-for-command-line-use/), and paste it into test.js (line 3).

You're ready to start developing!

#Develop
Run `node test.js` to see your GitHook in action. There's obviously not much going on until you write the code. This is a boilerplate project!

Best of luck. Hope you make something amazing!

#Contribute
When your GitHook is ready to use, please [contribute your GitHook](http://githooks.io/contribute) to GitHooks.io.

Please make absolutely sure you've not committed your personal access token to the repository at any point (and revoke your access token from GitHub just to be safe). The `test.js` file here is git-ignored by default, but even so, be careful.

Also, please fill out the details in `.githook.yml` properly before you contribute your GitHook.
